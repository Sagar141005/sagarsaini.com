      "Most online editors limit advanced features (real-time sync, versioning, AI) behind paywalls. Open-source options exist but lack polish and collaboration. CodeSphere was built to close this gap.",

    challenges: [
      {
        challenge: "Scoped Undo/Redo Across Multiple Files",
        solution:
          "Monaco Editor maintains a global undo stack, which caused conflicts when switching between files. To solve this, I implemented isolated editor models and bound custom history stacks per file, ensuring that undo/redo worked contextually without leaking changes across tabs.",
      },
      {
        challenge: "Efficient Real-time Collaboration at Scale",
        solution:
          "Naive broadcasting of entire file contents on every keystroke caused major performance issues. I switched to operational transforms with differential patches over Socket.io, reducing bandwidth by 80% and keeping cursor sync smooth even with 20+ concurrent users.",
      },
      {
        challenge: "Git-style Versioning in PostgreSQL",
        solution:
          "Storing entire file snapshots per commit was unsustainable. I designed a normalized Postgres schema that stores diffs per file, linked to commit metadata. This reduced storage usage drastically and allowed fast commit reverts by reconstructing file states from incremental diffs.",
      },
      {
        challenge: "Dependency Injection for Live Previews",
        solution:
          "Supporting per-room external libraries like React, Tailwind, and Lodash required building a safe injection mechanism. I implemented a scoped preview iframe system that dynamically loads CDN scripts while sandboxing execution, ensuring user isolation and avoiding global namespace conflicts.",
      },
      {
        challenge: "Realtime Presence & Awareness",
        solution:
          "Tracking online users, cursors, and file focus in real time was tricky. I built a presence service with ephemeral sessions, using heartbeats to track disconnections and avoid 'ghost users,' while ensuring minimal socket traffic overhead.",
      },
      {
        challenge: "Seamless Voice Chat Integration",
        solution:
          "Building low-latency WebRTC voice chat into collaborative rooms required handling peer connection management, NAT traversal, and stream cleanup on disconnects. I integrated socket signaling for peers and designed a fallback system to ensure reliable voice sessions even with unstable networks.",
