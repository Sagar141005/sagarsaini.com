# Career Hunt: Full-stack job board and application management platform

## Overview

Career Hunt is a dual-sided platform simulating a real-world startup product. It streamlines the hiring process by providing recruiters with structured pipelines and job seekers with AI-enhanced application tools. The architecture emphasizes scalability and performance, utilizing Docker for environment parity and Redis to handle high-traffic read operations.

## The Challenge

Managing job applications via spreadsheets is inefficient for seekers, while recruiters often face friction with overly complex, expensive Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). There was a need for a lightweight, centralized solution that democratizes access to ATS-like features and leverages AI to reduce the repetitive burden of application tailoring.

### Project Goals

- Demonstrate a clean, scalable full-stack architecture using the MERN stack
- Implement secure, multi-provider authentication (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn) via OAuth
- Integrate OpenAI to provide practical utility through resume improvements and cover letter generation
- Establish an end-to-end DevOps workflow using Docker and CI/CD pipelines
- Optimize database load for read-heavy operations using Redis caching

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **React (Vite)**: Fast, modern client-side framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for responsive design.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation.

### Backend

- **Node.js & Express**: Scalable server-side logic and API routes.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching high-traffic endpoints.

### Database

- **MongoDB (Mongoose)**: Flexible NoSQL database for handling variable job schemas.

### AI & Auth

- **OpenAI API**: Powers the generative AI features for resumes and cover letters.
- **OAuth**: Secure authentication via Google, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

### DevOps

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Vercel & Railway**: Hosting solutions for frontend and backend respectively.

## Key Features

### AI Content Generation

Leverages GPT models to analyze resumes for tone improvements and auto-generate context-aware cover letters.

### Recruiter Management Suite

Allows recruiters to post jobs with Markdown support, manage company profiles, and track candidate pipelines.

### Performance Caching

Implements Redis caching for job listings, reducing database load by approximately 40% during read-heavy traffic.

### Secure Authentication

Scalable OAuth implementation supporting multiple providers (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn) for seamless access.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Handling variable job description structures

**Solution:** Adopted a NoSQL approach (MongoDB) to accommodate flexible schemas for job posts (e.g., varying compensation models) without complex migrations.

### Optimizing read-heavy endpoints

**Solution:** Integrated Redis to cache the 'Browse Jobs' data for one hour, significantly reducing latency and server load.

### Ensuring cross-environment consistency

**Solution:** Utilized Docker to containerize the application, ensuring identical runtime behavior across local development (macOS/Windows) and production Linux servers.

### Improving AI relevance

**Solution:** Engineered specific prompts to combine candidate skills with job descriptions, preventing generic AI output and ensuring tailored cover letters.

## Roadmap

- Browser extension for one-click job saving
- Automated job import from LinkedIn/Indeed
- Collaborative recruiter dashboards for team-based hiring
- AI-driven mock interview assistant
- Advanced analytics for application conversion rates

## Outcome

A robust, Dockerized full-stack application that successfully bridges the gap between simple trackers and complex ATS platforms. It demonstrates proficiency in cloud-native deployment, database optimization, and third-party API integration.
