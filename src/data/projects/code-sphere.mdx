# CodeSphere: Real-time collaborative IDE with AI integration

## Overview

CodeSphere is a full-stack web IDE designed to address the complexities of cloud-based development environments. It leverages a service-oriented approach to handle sub-millisecond state synchronization between multiple users. By integrating the Monaco Editor with a custom WebSocket architecture, it replicates the fidelity of local development while adding cloud-native capabilities like presence detection and voice communication.

## The Challenge

Standard online editors often suffer from high latency during multi-user sessions, lack integrated debugging tools, or gate advanced features behind paywalls. There was a gap for an open-source, polished solution that combined real-time concurrency with modern tooling like AI assistance and dependency injection.

### Project Goals

- Solve latency challenges to manage sub-millisecond updates for multi-user editing
- Integrate context-aware AI pairing using OpenAI beyond simple auto-complete
- Demonstrate a scalable WebSocket architecture
- Implement a robust presence system and voice channels for seamless remote collaboration

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

The frontend is built to replicate a desktop-class IDE experience in the browser:

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and efficient routing.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures strict type safety across the complex editor state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, utility-first styling of the IDE interface.
- **Monaco Editor**: The core engine powering VS Code features like Intellisense.

### Backend

The backend is engineered for low-latency, real-time communication:

- **Node.js & Express**: Powers the core API and microservices.
- **Socket.IO**: Handles bidirectional events for cursor tracking and code updates.
- **OpenAI API**: integrated for the context-aware AI coding assistant.
- **NextAuth.js**: Secure authentication and session management.

### Infrastructure & Database

Designed for data integrity and scalable deployment:

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing user data and project metadata.
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access and schema management.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Vercel & Render**: Distributed hosting for frontend assets and backend services.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Synchronization

Bidirectional, low-latency communication via Socket.IO using operational transforms for conflict-free editing.

### VS Code Fidelity

Built on the Monaco Editor engine to provide Intellisense, syntax highlighting, and a familiar developer experience.

### AI Pair Programmer

Context-aware AI assistance for code refactoring, debugging, and generating explanations.

### Integrated Voice & Presence

WebRTC-powered voice channels and live presence indicators to facilitate immediate team communication.

### Dynamic Dependency Injection

Support for external libraries (e.g., Lodash, DayJS) with isolated live previews.

### Project Management

Full file system CRUD operations, folder nesting, and zip export capabilities.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Efficient real-time collaboration at scale

**Solution:** Moved away from naive HTTP polling to a WebSocket-based architecture using differential patches. This reduced bandwidth usage by approximately 80% and ensured smooth cursor synchronization for multiple concurrent users.

### Managing scoped undo/redo stacks

**Solution:** Implemented isolated editor models with custom history stacks per file to prevent global undo conflicts when users switch between active tabs.

### Versioning storage optimization

**Solution:** Designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema that stores incremental file diffs linked to commit metadata rather than full file snapshots, drastically reducing storage requirements.

### Secure dependency injection

**Solution:** Built a scoped preview iframe system that dynamically loads CDN scripts while sandboxing execution to prevent global namespace conflicts.

## Roadmap

- GitHub Integration (Push commits, Clone repositories)
- Advanced AI modes (Test case generation, Pair programming)
- In-room Video Conferencing
- Extended Language Runtime Support (Rust, Ruby, Go)
- Mobile and Tablet optimization

## Outcome

The project successfully established a low-latency, collaborative environment that mirrors desktop IDE performance. It demonstrates proficiency in handling complex state distribution, database normalization for version control, and real-time AI orchestration.
