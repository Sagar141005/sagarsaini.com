# Morphly: Service-oriented file utility and conversion platform

## Overview

Morphly is a file utility platform engineered to unify disparate digital workflows—such as PDF conversion, background removal, and document manipulation—into a single interface. Unlike standard CRUD applications, Morphly is designed to handle complex binary data streams. It utilizes a service-oriented architecture to isolate heavy computational logic, ensuring the core application remains responsive while managing dependencies across Node.js and Python environments.

## The Challenge

Users frequently rely on multiple unverified, ad-heavy third-party websites to perform basic file operations. This fragmented approach exposes users to security risks and inconsistent output quality. There was a need for a centralized, secure, and professional tool capable of handling diverse digital assets without compromising user data privacy.

### Project Goals

- Engineer a system capable of handling complex Buffer, Blob, and Stream data types beyond standard JSON APIs.
- Implement serverless file processing logic that avoids execution timeouts during heavy manipulation tasks.
- Orchestrate third-party AI models for computationally expensive operations like background removal.
- Establish a secure storage architecture for user assets using presigned URLs and cloud storage providers.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: robust framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across complex data structures.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for a clean, professional UI.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for handling file upload queues.

### Backend

- **Node.js (Next.js API)**: Handles API routing and orchestration.
- **Python (FastAPI)**: Microservice for AI processing and heavy computation.
- **LibreOffice (Headless)**: Containerized service for high-fidelity document conversion.

### Database & Auth

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured user and transaction data.
- **Prisma**: ORM for type-safe database queries.
- **NextAuth**: Secure authentication handling.
- **Supabase**: Managed database and auth services.

### Infrastructure & Payments

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent multi-language environments.
- **Vercel & Railway**: Hosting for frontend and backend microservices respectively.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud storage for media assets.
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for premium credit management.

## Key Features

### High-Fidelity Document Conversion

Utilizes a headless LibreOffice container to convert DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX formats to PDF with consistent rendering.

### AI-Powered Image Processing

Integrates Python-based AI models for background removal and supports various format conversions (PNG, JPG, WEBP).

### Microservice Architecture

Decouples the Next.js web application from Python AI services and file conversion workers to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

### Credit & Quota Management

Enforces file size limits and deducts user credits only upon successful conversion, integrated with Stripe for payments.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Blocking the Node.js event loop with heavy conversion tasks

**Solution:** Adopted a service-oriented architecture, offloading CPU-intensive PDF-to-DOCX conversion to a dedicated Python FastAPI microservice communicating via an internal Docker network.

### Managing binary dependencies in a serverless environment

**Solution:** Executed LibreOffice and Python processes in isolated containers to keep complex dependencies out of the main Node.js runtime, ensuring reproducible results.

## Roadmap

- Background job queue implementation (Redis / BullMQ)
- Asynchronous conversion workers
- Service-level health checks and centralized logging
- File compression options and format auto-detection

## Outcome

The project successfully established a production-ready, Dockerized platform. It demonstrates advanced handling of binary streams and the orchestration of multi-language microservices (Node.js and Python) to solve practical file manipulation problems.
