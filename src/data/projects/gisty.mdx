# Gisty: Privacy-centric AI webpage summarizer

## Overview

Gisty is a Chrome extension designed to enhance reading efficiency by generating instant summaries of web content. Built on the Manifest V3 standard, it utilizes a Node.js backend to interface with the Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite API. The tool emphasizes speed and privacy, delivering streamed, chunk-by-chunk responses without storing user data or browsing history.

## The Challenge

Digesting lengthy articles and documentation is time-consuming. Users often require quick insights or specific tonal adjustments (e.g., ELI5, Academic) without context-switching to external AI tools or compromising their browsing privacy.

### Project Goals

- Develop a low-latency summarization tool utilizing AI streaming APIs for instant feedback
- Implement a privacy-first architecture that ensures zero persistence of user inputs or summaries
- Create a seamless browser integration via Manifest V3 and Context Menus
- Support versatile content adaptation through multiple summary styles

## Technical Stack

### Extension Core

- **Manifest V3**: The modern standard for Chrome extension architecture.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Lightweight logic for content scripts and popups to ensure minimal overhead.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies for the interface.

### Backend

- **Node.js & Express**: Lightweight intermediary server to handle API requests securely.

### AI Model

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite API**: Selected for its high token throughput and cost-efficiency relative to performance.

### UI/Styling

- **Lucide Icons**: Clean, vector-based iconography.
- **Auto-Theme Detection**: Dynamic styling that respects the user's system appearance preferences.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Streaming

Delivers summaries chunk-by-chunk using Gemini’s streaming API to ensure immediate UI feedback rather than waiting for the full completion.

### Contextual Integration

Supports right-click context menu actions to summarize specific text selections or paragraphs without leaving the current tab.

### Adaptive Tones

Offers multiple summary styles including Professional, Academic, Sarcastic, and ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) to suit different reading needs.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Designed with strict data policies: no browsing data, inputs, logs, or summaries are stored on the server.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Providing instant feedback for long content

**Solution:** Implemented a streaming response architecture to display summary chunks in real-time rather than waiting for full generation.

### Seamless browser integration

**Solution:** Leveraged Manifest V3 to inject overlay UIs and context menus that adapt strictly to the user's system theme (Dark/Light).

## Outcome

A functional, privacy-preserving browser extension that successfully integrates advanced AI models into the daily browsing workflow, providing rapid information synthesis without data retention.
